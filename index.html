<div><h2>About us</h2>
<p>Welcome to cats R Us! We are a select group of individuals who made it our life purpose to have every cat have a home
  that once had one. We are very excited to announce the opening of our website, where we are going to post images of
  all cats that are up for adoption as well as cat toys and every other needs a cat will need.

    <h2>ADOPTION AREA</h2>
    <h3><span>PLEASE READ</span> Due to a high volume of unhappy adoptions we unfortunately must give a warning. While we love to have every cat adopted, some cats are born outside and will have issues being house trained, as a result, we recomment that if you are inexperienced handling highly tempermental cats we suggest adopting an indoor cat</h3>

    <p>Shrek
    <p>Shrek is a cat with a nasty upbrining, abandoned by his previous owners, he has become scared of the world. However, just like shrek, we believe he has many unopened layers that just needs the right owner to unlayer</p>
